    ## Description
    The purpose of this project is to create a node that helps generate a readme file for the user. By answering a few questions it will create the following sections: Title, Dscription, Usage, License, Contributions, and some contact information. This is a great tool to use when creating README's because it allows you to produce quality started documents without having to manually do it yourself.
